minesweeper game
====================

Welcome to my Minesweeper game! I hope you like it :)

====================

How to run (after downloading files): 
- compile with "javac *.java" if there aren't class files
- “java Minesweeper” (no quotes) to run

How to play: 
- click on all the spaces except for the mines. 
- reset the board by clicking on the button at the top (but you can only do this after clicking on the board at least once).

====================

Additional features:
- Flagging toggle: hover over a space and hit spacebar to flag it if it’s unflagged 
  and unflag it if it’s flagged (flagged spaces cannot be revealed)
- Difficulty select: hit 1, 2, or 3 for beginner, intermediate, and expert 
  respectively. difficulty changes take effect upon the next reset
- An easter egg: hit 0 after your first click on the board
